# Manager components

The manager component are components that are used to manage some tasks, without
needing to be visible to the user (eg. the calculator should be able to
autoconnect on every page, without the user having to do anything).

Manager components are just used to split up the (JavaScript) code into
different files, so that it is easier to maintain and disable.
